# Content Savior

The **Content Savior** is created as a part of learning react-router-dom

## Outcome

- React Router DOM
- `loader` and `useLoaderData` to prepare data for components before rendering
- `action` and `useFetcher` to call action without navigate to different URL
- Understand more about form element and its behavior, `<form action=''>` can be used to navigate around
- the `q=` search param in URL
- `useSubmit`, `navigate` and much more!

## Navigation

- My previous project [Memory Card Game](https://github.com/minhhoccode111/memory-card-top)
- All my projects' [live demos](https://github.com/minhhoccode111/all-projects-live-demos)
