Create as a part of learning react-router-dom

## What I've learned

`loader` and `useLoaderData` to prepare data for components before rendering
`action` and `useFetcher` to call action without navigate to different URL
understand more about form element and its behavior, `<form action=''>` can be used to navigate around
the `q=` search param in URL
`useSubmit`, `navigate` and much more!
